# Demo Explanation
The provided code is a JUnit test class for creating a user through a User Management API using Playwright in a Java environment. It demonstrates the creation of a user by sending a POST request with JSON data representing the user information. The test validates that the API responds with a status code of 201 (Created) and that the created user's information matches the input.

# Technical Solution
### Java and Playwright:

* The project is written in Java, a widely-used programming language.
* Playwright, a browser automation library, is utilized for making API requests.

### Lombok:

* Lombok is used to generate boilerplate code for the Users class, reducing the need for manual code writing.
* The @Builder annotation is applied to the Users class, allowing for easy creation of builder-pattern-based objects.

### API Testing Approach:

The test class follows a common approach in API testing: making POST requests to the API and validating the responses.
Assertions are used to ensure that the API responses meet the expected criteria.

### ObjectMapper (Playwright):

* The APIResponse class from Playwright is used to represent the response of an API request.
* The ObjectMapper class is used to convert JSON response text into a Java object (User).

# Implementation
* The createUserCallWithPojoLombokTest class extends BaseScript, which sets up the Playwright environment and provides methods for making API requests.
* The getRandomEmail method generates a random email address to ensure uniqueness for each test run.

### The createUsersTest method:
* Builds a Users object with user information using Lombok's builder pattern.
* Makes a POST request to the API endpoint specified by baseURL with the user information.
* Validates the response by checking the status code, status text, and the content of the created user.
* Converts the JSON response to a User object using ObjectMapper for further validation.
* Asserts that the created user's information matches the input.
